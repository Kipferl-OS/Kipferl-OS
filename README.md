<!--
**Kipferl-OS/Kipferl-OS** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->
There's no OS involved really, I just like succumbing myself in whatever distribution comes handy, I may even develop an obsession for it. Same for croissants!
